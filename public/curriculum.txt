how the stuff we actually love shapes what we make

the taste gap
closing the distance between “meh” and something crazy good

Practical: “Build some shit that actually works”
brand in a weekend because why not
zero to a real thing, just to see if you can do it

designing for the kids who say ‘ok boomer’
gen z: what gets us hyped, what makes us bounce

less or more or...does it even matter?
minimalism vs maximalism, picking what feels right

try, break, fix, repeat
making a mess and making it better

inside the founder’s brain (feat. our ceo)
honestly, it’s chaos, it’s obsession, it’s the good stuff

not screwing up the world
how to design ethically (for the actual internet, not some ideal)

work on shit that’s happening right now
live briefs, market problems, no fake projects

Portfolio: “Your work, your story, your mess”
writing the story people actually want to read
killer case studies that make them care

the reason why (always matters more)
not just what you made, but why you fought for it

going deep, then deeper
revisiting the boring fundamentals (that matter)

show your mom, show your client
perspective from people who don’t live on Dribbble

portfolio surgeries (no mercy)
teardown, rebuild, do it better

the stuff nobody notices, but everyone feels
details, details, details

Specializations: “Pick your poison (and also get the antidote for free)”
graphic design lane:

systems, not just logos

making sick icons for the hell of it

posters/magazines/ads people actually like

frontend dev lane:

making it real, not just a pretty figma figment

micro-interactions: little stuff, big impact

responsive magic, not just resizing

video editing lane:

storyboarding before you even open premiere

motion that pulls you in

viral edits for the world that scrolls

(But hey, you get all the videos for every lane. Watch what you want. Learn what you want. No gatekeeping.)

Internship: “No classroom left—just the real world”
inside the startup kitchen
hanging out with people who are building brands faster than most people order coffee

the underdogs, the weirdos, the potential legends
working with Indian brands nobody’s hyped about (yet)

market says you suck or you rule
getting real feedback from outside your bubble

creators + marketers + devs: the holy alliance
team ups that get actual stuff shipped

launch week—no more drafts
see if your thing survives the wild

the impact nobody sees, but everyone feels
legacy, closure, moving on, and leaving something behind
